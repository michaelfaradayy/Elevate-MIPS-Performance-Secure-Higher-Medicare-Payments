 is crucial for healthcare providers to ensure they are properly reimbursed by Medicare. At **iMagnum Healthcare Solution**, we specialize in **MIPS Consulting Services** to help practices improve their performance and secure higher Medicare payments.

## What is MIPS?
The **MIPS reporting service** is part of the **Quality Payment Program (QPP)**, designed to assess and reimburse healthcare providers based on the quality, cost, and efficiency of care they deliver. Accurate reporting across key MIPS categories can lead to higher reimbursement rates and avoidance of penalties.

MIPS evaluates providers in four categories:
1. **Quality**: Assesses the quality of care provided.
2. **Cost**: Evaluates cost efficiency.
3. **Promoting Interoperability**: Focuses on the use of certified EHR technology for patient engagement and health information exchange.
4. **Improvement Activities**: Looks at activities designed to improve clinical practice and patient engagement.
